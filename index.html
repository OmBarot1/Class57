		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
        <p> Hi! My name is Om ! I am a coder , I love drawing , I love building things from Lego,I love playing warzone which is a video game, and I love playing baseball! I been playing baseball since i was 5 and I been drawing since i was 4 , too! I never knew how to code until I saw my cousin taking coding classes so I thought that is was pretty cool so I asked my parents if I could start taking coding classes, too!</p>
            
       <p> Soon I started to code apps , and then websites! I learned ho wo draw from my mom when i was 4! She is a great drawer! She taught me how to write neatly and how to talk , and walk , and also to draw! After I started to watch Youtube videos on how to draw characters and cars, etc. </p>  
        
        <p> I remember my first Lego set was given to me by my friend on my birthday. Thats when i started to love building things! I been playing video games on my ps4 since i was  9 years old. When Coronavirus started in New york there was a deal from  the playstation company saying you will be able to download games for free for a certain amount of time and when i was looking for games I came across Call of Duty Warzone. Thats when i started playing and told my friend to download it so that we can play together </p>
        
        <p> I started to play baseball because I used to go to karate classes next to my house and one day it closed so my dad knew i liked watching baseball so he spoke to my mom and she said ok so from then I been playing baseball and I am really good at it now! I play first base and pitcher . I am also good at batting , too!</p>
